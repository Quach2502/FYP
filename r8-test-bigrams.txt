deficit cuts seen unable to cure trade deficit financial analysts say they are pleased with congressional moves to trim next year s federal budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help improve the u s trade deficit or buoy the economy the house of representatives is expected to vote tomorrow to approve a trillion dollar budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year that reduces the deficit by billion dlrs similarly the senate budget committee has approved a plan that would cut federal red ink by about billion dlrs next year in terms of the economy billion dlrs is infinitesimal so cuts of this magnitude will have little impact on the economy and the trade deficit said stanley collander a touche ross federal budget policy analyst at best it will have a small positive effect collander said in an interview federal reserve board chairman paul volcker has repeatedly told congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar the u s government has attempted to remedy the trade imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar but volcker has warned that a further fall in the dollar s value is fraught with danger such a decline he has said could refuel inflation as imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit in addition in february u s officials meeting with other major industrialized nations in paris agreed that the value of the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates should be stabilized at around current levels as part of that agreement japan and west germany agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies and the united states agreed to cut its budget deficit the alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a way to deal with the trade deficit volcker said recently is to reduce u s consumption particularly federal spending if you don t deal with the budget deficit everything else you do is going to be counterproductive volcker said in recent testimony before the senate banking committee volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the government s purse strings than have the fed tighten the credit supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the united states analysts say that fed tightening now could choke off the current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession kemper financial services economist john silvia stressed that any deficit reduction was better than none but he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to give the federal reserve board the flexibility it needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar from plunging further in world exchange markets there s no doubt that some deficit reduction helps but if your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the fed s flexibility to conduct monetary policy then the answer is it s not enough silvia told reuters the u s trade deficit has become one of the government s most vexing and persistent problems the deficit was billion dlrs and there is as yet little indication that this year s figure will be any lower though administration officials have predicted it will drop by about to billion dlrs by year s end in the past volcker has joked that he never lost sleep worrying whether congress would cut too much fat from the federal budget on the other hand he also has made it clear he is not attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for the period by last year s gramm rudman balanced budget law while the new law set a ceiling of billion dlrs for next year s federal deficit both the house and senate budget committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall short of the deficit reduction goal by about billion dlrs for political reasons to billion dlrs is about the most you re going to get out of congress at the present time said touche ross s collander to do something more than that would be extraordinary remarkable and very very difficult collander said the real danger for congress was to end up short of the deficit reduction goal set by its budget panels to an extent this has become the minimum acceptable reduction level he explained anything less than that will now look like a failure to wall street the budget plan now under debate on the house floor would lower an estimated billion dlr deficit for the year beginning on october one to about billion dlrs by cutting defense and domestic programs by billion dlrs from their anticipated spending levels for next year the senate budget committee has called for a deficit of nearly billion dlrs with about billion dlrs in new taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts reuter

treasury s baker says system needs stability treasury secretary james baker said the floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances from emerging in the global economy in remarks before the afternoon session of the international monetary fund s interim committee baker said he was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned but i do suggest he said that we need something to give it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction when the wind shifts he said that indicators can serve as a kind of compass but added that structural indicators can help focus attention on some policies baker however said the imf needs to move beyond macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific relevance to the imbalances we face today the treasury secretary said that indicators should be given a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews article iv consultations that the fund performs baker also told the policy making group that it was time for the imf to adopt earlier recommendations making imf surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the public in particular we urge increased publicity for imf appraisals developed in article iv consultations the use of follow up reports on country actions to implement imf recommendations and greater use of special consultation procedures he said baker emphasized that indicators were a device for moving beyond rhetoric to action he said they provide more structure to the system and induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of policy coordination he said the fund s procedures for surveillance need to be reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators this should be matter of priority for the executive board he said baker also urged the fund to develop alternative medium term economic scenarios for countries that can help us focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances by identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the implications of these options he said also that further work should be done on finding paths that lead toward possible medium term objectives if we are to take effective remedial action when there are significant deviations from an intended course then we must have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for key variables he said reuter

british minister says he warned tokyo of sanctions a british minister said he had given the japanese government a clear warning of sanctions against japanese companies if tokyo did not allow more access to its internal markets and it was clearly understood corporate affairs minister michael howard said on his return from a visit to japan he thought the japanese were beginning to appreciate the need to be fair and open about access to their own markets at an airport news conference howard denied opposition charges that his trip had been a failure because he had returned empty handed i did what i set out to do i was sent to deliver a clear message to the japanese government and i delivered it very clearly and it has been clearly understood howard said that under the financial services act the govenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions against japanese companies and finance houses operating in britain it is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing operating licences we can ban firms from certain countries from carrying out certain kinds of business while allowing them to carry out other kinds i hope we don t have to use these powers but i made it clear in japan that if our timetable isn t met we shall use them he said it would be unfortunate if britain and japan became involved in a tit for tat exchange adding that japan gained more than anyone else from an open trading relationship i think they are beginning to appreciate that if this relationship is to continue it is very important for them to be fair and open about access to their own markets on the question of the british firm cable and wireless plc cawl l which is trying to win a significant share of telecommunications contracts in japan howard said he had told the japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case he said there were signs of movement on the case cable and wireless was due to take part in talks in japan next tuesday he said earlier this week british prime minister margaret thatcher said britain could not go it alone on sanctions against japan but would have to coordinate action with its european community partners community sources said after a meeting of trade officials yesterday that the group might impose steep new tariffs on a range of japanese goods to prevent diversion from united states markets if washington imposes trade sanctions against tokyo as it has threatened reuter

ec could decide on japan trade moves in late may the european community ec has effectively given japan six weeks to take moves to open its market to imports before it decides on possible tough retaliatory trade measures ec diplomats said they said ec foreign ministers will meet on may and to review the state of trade relations between the two sides the ec executive commission was asked by representatives of member states on friday to propose a renunciation of some ec pledges to the world trade body gatt unless there are adequate and early measures to open the japanese market such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing stiff increases in duties or quantitative limits on japanese exports the diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be discussed in detail at the next meeting of ec foreign ministers on april and in luxembourg as time was needed to prepare proposals for possible retaliatory action they said the commission has powers to take some limited action before getting ministerial approval to prevent japanese exports of electrical photographic and other goods being diverted to europe following of possible u s tariff moves in may the ministers are also likely to discuss how to prevent japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a result of spain and portugal joining the bloc which obliges them gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods japan s trade surplus with the community has grown steadily registering a record billion dlrs in march reuter

japan farm reform a key to trimming trade surplus basic reform of japan s protected farm sector is a key to shifting its economy away from export to domestic led growth a vital step if it is to trim its trade surplus securities analysts said the farm sector which is protected by import tariffs and quotas propped up by subsidies and price supports and sheltered by the tax system has ample room for change they said in economic terms reform would be a plus said christopher chew of brokerage firm james capel and co the ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices twice those in europe and two to three times those in the u s the analysts said spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the average household s budget and roughly pct of the gross national product gnp according to a study by chew reducing these prices could increase household spending power by five pct his study said the money could be spent on products which would have a more direct impact in boosting domestic growth it added there s a lot of slack a u s government official in tokyo said all that money could be spent on something else direct central government subsidies to the farm sector amount to some five billion dlrs per year independent estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential development would also give a boost to domestic spending economists said housing construction is the key strategic variable in the expansion of domestic demand wrote chihiro nakajima professor at kyoto gakuen university japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the farm sector employers groups also want change if you really want to expand domestic demand the way to do it is not to raise wages recklessly but to reduce commodity prices bumpei otsuki president of the japan federation of employers associations told a recent press conference external pressures are rising as the u s and europe seek removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade deficits with japan but vested japanese interests opposed to change remain well entrenched dimming prospects for quick reform analysts said although the full time farm population is falling and there are signs the ldp is paying more attention to urban constituencies the ruling party remains heavily dependent on farm votes in the rural areas one rural vote is worth several city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders the ldp is already in political trouble over its tax reform plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon the analysts said consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for national food security they said powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to import liberalisation but are more flexible about reforms aimed at stepping up productivity they said reform when it comes will be in response to specific pressure rather than an all embracing program said chew reuter

japanese tariffs seen as worldwide warning the tough trade sanctions president reagan imposed on japanese exports are not only a shot across japan s bow but also a sign reagan will attack unfair trade practices worldwide u s officials said but robert crandall a trade specialist at brookings institution a think tank said a shot across their bow can often result in a shot in our stern he said it left the united states open to retaliation the u s officials said the pct tariffs reagan ordered on mln dlrs worth of japanese goods will also show congress that a tough pro trade stand can be taken under existing laws and no new protectionist legislation is needed in the past year tough trade action had been taken against the european community over corn and sorghum taiwan over beer and wine south korea over counterfeiting of copyrights patents and trademarkets and japan on tobacco white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters the tariffs up from five pct should be seen as a serious signal to other nations on the need for fair trade practices reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers television sets and some hand tools because japan did not honor an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its markets to u s products the tariffs were placed on items which were available from other sources so there would be little effect on the american consumer fitzwater said reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action especially against japan to end global unfair trade practices and reverse the growing u s trade deficit the alternative was that if he did not congress would the u s trade gap last year was a record billion dlrs and continues to rise with japan accounting for about one third of america s overall deficit but there are other two way deficits with canada west germany taiwan and south korea and reagan officials said the president is ready to fight them all reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that i regret that these actions are necessary but that the health and vitality of the u s semiconductor industry was essential to american competitiveness in world markets we cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading practices reagan added in the statement from his california vacation home at santa barbara he said the tariffs would remain in force until japan abided by the agreement u s officials say the action today will show congress which is about to write a trade bill he does not like that he already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade the white house aide said of the tariff action it wasn t done to appease congress but because there was an unfair trade practice the aide added however on another plane it was an example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight unfair practices an that it is not necessary to make a major overall of our trade laws but the analyst crandall said the tariff action was not in the best interests of the united states and that negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue it s very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route he said because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in trade crandall said the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country and therefore its impact on congress he said i don t think it makes a lot of sense but other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at u s trading partners or congress and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was a weapon reagan was ready to use spokesman fitzwater said we don t want a trade war but the imposition of sanctions showed the united states would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated crandall said the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country and therefore its impact on congress he said i don t think it makes a lot of sense but other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at u s trading partners or congress and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was a weapon reagan was ready to use spokesman fitzwater said we don t want a trade war but the imposition of sanctions showed the united states would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated reuter

u s study says tariffs and quotas could backfire the use of tariffs and quotas to reduce the flow of foreign goods into the united states will do little to cut the nation s swelling trade deficit a government study said in fact the federal trade commission ftc report said such protectionist policies could make u s products less competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of imported products that are re exported in different forms such policies are much more likely to hurt rather than help the productive capabilities of the u s economy it said the page report written by ftc economists john hilke and philip nelson blamed the rising trade shortfall which climbed to a record billion dlrs last year on shifting currency exchange rates and growing u s consumer demand other factors commonly blamed for the deficit such as foreign trade practices deteriorating u s industrial competitiveness high labour costs and government restrictions on mergers added little to the problem it said although each industry s competitiveness affects the level of imports and exports in that industry in general we find that there have been no significant industry specific changes affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in the overall trade deficit the study said to the extent any government action is needed to deal with the trade deficits policies should focus on economy wide phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth the ftc study said supporting its conclusion that broad based economic shifts were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit the report said it found that nearly all u s industries lost some domestic market share to foreign competitors in the s it also said it found a fairly direct relationship between the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting currency exchange rates u s economic growth and domestic demand for goods and services which has outpaced foreign consumer demand the study examined seven factors which have been commonly blamed for the trade deficit foreign government subsidies and trade barriers to protect foreign industries a lack of investment in u s industry declining research and development in u s industry high labour costs union work rules the oil prices rises of the s and u s antitrust regulations in each case the study found little or no evidence that the factor had any impact on the trade deficit reuter

u k bankers consider new ecgd financing plan representatives of major u k based banks are meeting here today to consider a new plan for reducing the cost of financing british exports guaranteed by the export credits guarantee department ecgd senior banking sources said the plan is being developed in conjunction with the ecgd and the bank of england neither the ecgd nor the bank of england would comment on the plan however bankers said one of the main points under discussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ecgd s medium term credit portfolio in the international capital markets the proposals involve introducing a set of interest margins on ecgd backed debt of to pct depending on the size and maturity of the credit and the currency the banks are likely to push for a higher margin bankers said that while these rates would reduce a bank s return they would still be more than those proposed about a year ago when the government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate another cost reduction plan at the same time the banks would be expected to allow the ecgd to realise additional savings by refinancing existing government backed credit in the capital markets on credits that are refinanced an original lender would receive a residual margin of pct for loans up to mln stg and pct on larger transactions reuter

lawson says louvre currency accord satisfactory the louvre agreement by the group of seven finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the economic summit in venice on june u k chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said previewing the summit which he expected would not produce any major new economic initiatives lawson told reporters work remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting world economic growth side measures to boost growth he said i think it is possible that there may be scope for a further reduction in interest rates in germany he added but stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was likely he made no mention of japanese interest rates lawson said the u s should embark on a gradual reduction of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years he said the february louvre accord had produced satisfactory exchange rate stability in part thanks to heavy coordinated intervention of group of seven central banks and he was content with sterling s exchange rate pointing to the record billion stg rise in u k may currency reserves announced today he said we have been playing a very full part ourselves we have been intervening to a very much greater extent than we had done hitherto lawson said there was a risk that the louvre agreement may falter if member states did not implement the macro economic commitments underlying the accord certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their commitments in paris in this respect he said the u s budget deficit was very important noting the billion yen economic package announced by japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone last week lawson said what is really needed in japan is an increase in merchandise imports supply side measures are critical there is a specific range of consumer and agricultural goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is wholly unjustified he said lawson doubted that tokyo s partners would indulge in japan bashing at the summit especially after the economic stimulation package and the announcement of nakasone s plans to increase japanese development aid over the next three years japan s more flexible stance on tokyo stock exchange membership would also help deflect criticism he said he said he thought west germany would instead come under pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to jack up faltering economic growth in this respect lawson said he hoped bonn would bring forward to january part of its agreed package of tax cuts scheduled for he also called on bonn to push ahead with the privatisation of german national industries on debt lawson said he expected a three point british plan to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub saharan countries to make progress in venice the plan involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign debt in the paris club was first proposed at the imf and world bank meetings in washington earlier this year lawson said he would seek to consolidate political backing for the plan at the venice summit and hoped the programme would be finalised at the autumn meetings of the imf and world bank he welcomed the recent moves by citicorp and chase manhattan to increase sharply their third world debt provisions first it is a blow for realism second because the market response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this sort of move than they felt before citicorp he said u k banks should follow bank of england recommendations strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions they have done it to some extent they need to do it more lawson said adding it was up to the banks themselves to determine the appropriate size of provisions he also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be discussed at the summit there is a consensus which we have to push further reuter

shultz welcomes tokyo economic package u s secretary of state george shultz said the billion yen economic package announced by tokyo last week went further than the u s had expected but he said the u s would not lift the selective economic sanctions it imposed on japanese imports in april until tokyo changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips speaking in a televised news conference linking several european capitals shultz said it was heartening that the japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and global demand there is an even greater amount of stimulus than was originally thought said shultz speaking from washington it is a lot more than nothing it is more than was talked about when prime minister yasuhiro nakasone was here it involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the economy he added but asked by japanese reporters also linked into the news conference whether the positive reaction meant the u s might decide at next week s venice summit to lift its sanctions on some japanese electronic goods shultz replied these sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an agreement that had been reached between the united states and japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip market they will be lifted as the facts of change by japan to the agreement that it made become evident he said u s officials had only been able to monitor the situation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a trend on only one month s data the u s imposed pct import duties on personal computers colour televisions and power tools alleging that japan had violated last september s bilateral agreement by selling computer chips at below fair market value shultz said west germany and other nations would also do well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand asked whether the u s could reasonably ask its allies to take action to stimulate the world economy without a bold american initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget deficit shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the problem he said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit would probably be reduced by around billion dlrs against last year and that the budget being worked on this year would contain a major reduction reuter

investment crucial to u s textile recovery with more private investment not more protection the u s textile industry could become competitive with the most modern foreign producers analysts from two congressional agencies said today the office of technology assessment a nonpartisan arm of congress told a house ways and means trade subcommittee hearing there was still concern for the future of parts of the u s textile and apparel industry but there was more reason for optimism than a few years ago while textile producers are making significant investments they could do more ota analyst henry kelly said the congressional budget office cbo the nonpartisan budget analysis arm of congress said federal loans or loan guarantees would be preferable options for congress rather than increased trade protection which could lead to foreign retaliation cbo analyst edward gramlich said past trade protections first imposed in the s have had only a small benefit for profits and investments of domestic firms trade subcommittee chairman rep sam gibbons said the agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against congressional approval of protectionist textile quota legislation aimed mainly at western europe japan and other asian textile producing countries president reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill but it was reintroduced in this session of congress and is expected to be voted on in the house this year however approval this year is in doubt because passage of a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles showed a weakening of support for the legislation most u s producers have fallen behind other foreign producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic markets kelly said he added that private investment in the textile and clothing industry in of pct was less than one seventh the average manufacturing investment of pct despite existing import quotas and tariffs imports of textiles grew pct in and imports of apparel grew pct while u s production rose only pct the traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by new technology imports or some combination of both while the industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets that it enjoyed twenty years ago the results of our research indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered and that exports can be expanded kelly said reuter

opec differentials not seen posing major problems some opec states are unhappy about the prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose great problems when the group reviews its six month old price and output pact in vienna next week oil analysts say they said nigeria which holds the opec conference presidency and qatar probably have the biggest grievances about price differentials making some of their crudes uncompetitive there has also been speculation by japanese traders that opec might want to mark up prices of high sulphur heavy crudes to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices but most experts agree that a major overhaul of price differentials is unlikely so as to avoid giving the market signals of a dent in opec s new unity all opec members can make a good case for changing differentials said one analyst with a major oil company but at the end of the day the attitude is going to be leave well alone and little or nothing is likely to be altered iran libya and saudi arabia are among those who also saw sales problems earlier this year traders say but diminished customer resistance to fixed prices and in some cases marketing incentives have helped their sales some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by means of discounts processing deals or selling them alongside better priced grades in a package many opec crudes are seen to be reasonably priced at least for some part of the year but many experts say opec should change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for fuel oil rich heavy crudes and gasoline rich lighter grades at its last meeting in december opec agreed to reintroduce fixed prices from february around an dlr per barrel reference point official prices had been effectively dropped in when members offered discounts to attract customers opec also decided to limit first half output to mln bpd and proposed ceilings of mln for the third quarter and mln for the fourth analysts expect it will now extend or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months spot market and netback values for some crudes do not mirror official prices but opec will probably keep the dlr target and at most make minimal changes to differentials analysts say the dlr figure is based on a basket of six opec and one non opec crudes opec assigned prices to its other key export crudes with a dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest extra heavy crudes were among those left out industry estimates vary on the proportion of opec oil exports actually sold at official prices several experts say only one quarter to one third of the total in fact sells at official prices with some of the rest included in processing or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year when some producers output fell due to customer reluctance to pay the new prices nigeria especially found its gasoline rich bonny light crude now opec s highest priced grade at dlrs a barrel was uncompetitive on the spot market against britain s brent in february and march nigeria s production shrank below its mln bpd opec quota spot prices have since revived due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline and its output has risen some experts feel bonny light is still overvalued and say its price should be cut by between cts to one dlr a barrel but mehdi varzi chief oil analyst with london s kleinwort grieveson securities doubts nigeria will actively push the differentials question in vienna it would not look good for opec unity if nigeria which holds the presidency raised the issue he said reuter

u s canada ties seen worse without trade pact u s canadian ties could worsen if the two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policy research groups the cato institute of washington and the fraser institute of vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on cross border trade would benefit both countries but cato chairman william niskanen added the two nations generally harmonious trade relations are probably not sustainable without a new agreement the united states and canada whose cross border trade totaled about billion dlrs last year have been holding talks since last june on a pact to end the few trade barriers remaining between their two countries the u s put a deadline on the talks of october but both sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining remained niskanen said if no pact is reached bilateral trade ties could deteriorate because of congressional pressure on president reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively and this could hit some canadian trade practices he noted canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto industry which could put strains on the considerable bilateral free trade in u s and canadian autos and parts niskanen also said the canadian government is vulnerable to a resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict u s exports to canada a free trade pact backed by president reagan and prime minister brian mulroney would open new markets for canada and enable its industries to achieve economies of scale which would also help it widen exports worldwide he said it would also increase the gross national products of both countries niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end all tariffs within years lower subsidies on exports set rules for trade in services and investments end curbs on government procurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes reuter

u k lenders offer more fixed rate mortgages more u k lenders are offering homebuyers fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other interest rates and with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in years the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers trying to lock into cheap money the decision to offer fixed rate loans industry officials said reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home mortgage business while fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the u k they were the mainstay of the business in the u s up until only a few years ago but in the early s interest rates soared u s lenders mostly savings and loan associations were earning rates as low as three pct on year fixed rate mortgages they held in their portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as pct to induce them to retain their accounts as a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were forced to merge the survivors decided to offer mortgages whose rates would move in line with the cost of funds we very much have the example of the u s thrifts in mind said a spokesman for abbey national building society explaining why his institution for the time being is only offering variable rate mortgages the rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders concede they are being forced to undercut each other still more sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier this week by the nation s two largest building societies and by national westminster bank plc reflect growing competition for new business officials at all three institutions said the fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even below those on the variable rate loans of course they are less profitable than other variable rate mortgages said a spokesman for midland bank plc which earlier this year said it earmarked mln dlrs for fixed rate new mortgage loans but he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable loans because it was just another way to attract people to our mortgage product trustee savings bank plc tsb was offering five year fixed rate mortgages at pct earlier this year the mln stg that tsb set aside for the loans was exhausted within just a few days according to a spokeswoman everybody loves an under pct mortgage she said noting that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of pct of its volume in short the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest rates if interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the lender is earning an above average return on assets but if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won the benefit of cheap money household mortgage co had planned to offer a year fixed rate mortgage after the june elections on the assumption that a conservative party victory would help money market rates fall further according to duncan young managing director young explained that the company had planned to protect itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a complicated hedging instrument but money market rates have risen contrary to expectations and the company has shelved its plans for the time being he said money market rates were too high to arrange both the mortgages and hedge profitably however he said that when the household mortgage co does make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them this means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond and selling them to an investor for technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate mortgages in the u s where fixed rate mortgages are popular again securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money over the past few years reuter

new leader coming to u s sec in challenging era president reagan s nominee as top policeman for the nation s securities markets will inherit an agency challenged by an insider trading scandal wild stock price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the globalization of financial markets david ruder a year old republican law professor at northwestern university in evanston ill was named thursday to be the rd chairman of the five member u s securities and exchange commission if confirmed by the senate as expected he will succeed john shad who left the agency earlier this week after a record six years as chairman to become ambassador to the netherlands the sec has been in the limelight for the past year as its investigators have probed into the most colossal insider trading scandal ever uncovered on wall street the investigation which is still active mushroomed in recent months as a growing number of well known traders and prominent investment banking firms have been charged with wrongdoing the pace of the probe picked up markedly in november after ivan boesky one of wall street s most successful stock speculators agreed to cooperate with government investigators and to pay a record mln dlrs in penalties and illegal profits after being charged with insider trading but the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices spurred by computer driven trading strategies that span markets in securities options and futures the price gyrations have combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented volatility to some u s securities markets at the same time the sec is being pressed by some lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers steadily reshapes the u s corporate landscape and the agency is being pushed by u s and foreign exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork for an international securities marketplace in which trading occurs across borders throughout the world around the clock such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment opportunities but could strain the sec s ability to enforce u s securities laws and guard investors from fraud under the leadership of shad the sec eased financial disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies eliminated many minor investor protection rules attempted to spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency s review of hostile corporate takeovers shad who had been vice chairman of the e f hutton investment banking firm brought a wall street perspective to the agency upon being named chairman in in line with the views of other top administration officials he favored marketplace determination of takeover battles over new federal regulations the sec under shad also stressed prosecution of insider trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that topped the agency s enforcement agenda during the administration of president jimmy carter a democrat securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with ruder say the new chairman designate is unlikely to significantly alter the commission s current priorities the sec currently has about employees most of them lawyers and an annual budget of about mln dlrs though that figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff the agency is one of the few in the government that actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past few years because of fees it charges public companies investment banks and other securities firms it regulates the sec is structured as an independent regulatory agency meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the president to fixed five year terms and protected from firing for policy differences alone by law no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party and the agency prepares its own budget request each year instead of leaving this to the white house established by congress in the sec traces its origins to the great stock market crash of which was attributed in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted market manipulations by large investment firms the agency requires public companies and investment vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on their financial condition and to disclose changes in their condition any time they issue new securities it requires brokers dealers and investment banks to register with it and comply with investor protection rules and it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices its first chairman was joseph kennedy an industrial magnate who was also the father of john kennedy later to become the nation s th president other former chairmen include william douglas who served from until his appointment to the u s supreme court in and william casey who served during president nixon s first term and was reagan s director of the central intelligence agency until his death earlier this year reuter

poehl says rate rises are cause for concern rises in west german and international interest rates are a cause for concern and the bundesbank has no interest in higher capital market rates bundesbank president karl otto poehl said we consider the interest rate increase that has occurred here and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern poehl told an investment conference i would like to stress that the bundesbank has no interest in higher capital market rates he said shortly after poehl spoke the bundesbank announced a tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of pct previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to pct at last week s pact from on the last fixed rate tender in late september the bundesbank s reduction of the key allocation rate to from pct was heralded monday by repeated injections of money market liquidity at between and pct these moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting between poehl finance minister gerhard stoltenberg and u s treasury secretary james baker monday in frankfurt officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed their commitment to the louvre accord on currency stability over the weekend criticism by baker of the tightening in west german monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the dollar on speculation that louvre cooperation had ended but the dollar rallied on news of monday s meeting in nervous trading to trade above marks tuesday poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not due to central bank policy but to markets expectations and currency developments commenting on the inflationary expectations poehl said you have to get to the root of the problem you have to pursue a policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears the inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated he said poehl rebuffed recent u s criticism of west germany saying the bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to international cooperation in interest and monetary policy the bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money supply target arousing criticism from other quarters he said today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of quite the contrary of other countries where interest rates have risen substantially more poehl said this had to be taken into account when considering recent rises in repurchase pact allocation rates which were due to rising international money market rates that had spilled over into the german market he said poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far ignored improvements in the u s deficits the adjustment process in the u s trade balance is definitely underway he said noting that this was not so noticeable in absolute figures the spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also attracted little attention he said reuter

tokyo stock plunge could force easier money policy plunging tokyo stock prices will prevent the bank of japan from raising its discount rate and could even force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues government and private economists said a rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major deflationary impact on the real economy they said although bank of japan officials have consistently maintained that they had no plans to raise the pct discount rate many in the markets have thought otherwise fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the central bank s apparent decision last week to countenance higher rates on commercial bills dealers said but today s stock market collapse prices fell nearly pct means that the bank of japan would be hard pressed to raise the discount rate now despite its concerns about a renewed outbreak of inflation dealers and economists said japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the markets concluded that the stock market s collapse precluded the central bank from carrying out the widely rumoured discount rate increase a senior government economist suggested that both the u s and japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a further drop in new york and tokyo stock prices they need to support the stock and security markets he said but bank of japan officials said they saw no need to change policy for the moment although one admitted that the central bank may have to rethink its strategy if tokyo stock prices continue to plunge during the rest of the week both government and bank of japan economists agreed the economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago with the economy recovering strongly the steep drop in stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and business confidence one government economist said there will be some impact on the real economy but it won t be that big said another individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their own although they do participate through trust funds and other investment vehicles and while many manufacturing firms turned to financial market investments for profits during last year s economic downturn the recent rebound has allowed them to refocus their attention on their core businesses he said paradoxically it is the pick up in the economy that is partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have shifted funds away from financial investments to increase inventories and step up capital spending one government economist said in deciding what response to make to the steep stock price drop the bank of japan must first determine whether prices will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation one central bank official said that will at least take a couple of days if not weeks he said reuter
